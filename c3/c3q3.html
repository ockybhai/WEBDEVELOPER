<p>Wayanad is a hill station in Kerala, which attracts a large number of local as well as foreign tourists. The chilling climate in Wayanad with its marvellous natural beauty makes it one of the best tourist attractions in God’s own Country and called as the green paradise of Kerala.
 Some of the major tourist attractions in Wayanad are Edakkal Caves, Chembra Peak, Lakkidi View Point, Kuruvadweep and Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. I was on a budget trip and also wasn’t in a hurry to visit all the locations.</p>
